# Employee-Management-System
This project involves developing a graphical user interface (GUI) using C# to manage employee data through CRUD operations. The objective is to create a system that allows users to perform essential operations, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting employee records, all of which will be stored and managed in an SQL database.
